# Miguel Carvalho — Portfolio

A modern, interactive **Windows-style portfolio** built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Framer Motion**.  
The interface simulates a desktop environment, complete with draggable windows, folders, and a dynamic taskbar showcasing my projects, CV, and system-like details in a playful yet professional way.
